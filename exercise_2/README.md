## Urban Interactions: A Glimpse into My Living Space

For this second exercise, I delved into the intricate task of creating a graphical document that seamlessly merges various representation systems and scales, focusing on the intricacies of my domestic space. The cornerstone of this endeavor was the development of a detailed 3D model of my room, meticulously crafted with my floor plan as the guiding blueprint. Leveraging the sophisticated capabilities of Rhino 7, particularly the MAKE2D command, I embarked on this creative journey, aiming to encapsulate the essence of my living environment.

1) **Primary Rendering**: A 1:50 isometric drawing served as the focal point of my project. In this rendition, I rendered myself within the room using isometric mode. To enhance the visual depth and convey nuanced perspectives, I strategically utilized a diverse array of line types, including continuous, dashed, and dotted lines. These variations facilitated the creation of transparency effects, particularly when illustrating elements that intersect or overlap within the space.

2) **Detailed Exploration**: Venturing into a more granular exploration, I crafted 1:10 axonometric drawings of three select objects within my room. These objects hold particular significance in my daily life. First, Hershey's water bowl was meticulously detailed, symbolizing both functionality and affection as it ensures Hershey's hydration while maintaining cleanliness. Next, the bedside table emerged as a pivotal element, embodying my penchant for working in the cozy confines of my bed. Lastly, the projector, a cherished entertainment companion, was intricately rendered, reflecting my love for immersive cinematic experiences.

3) **Broad Perspective**: Expanding the scope of my project, I incorporated a 1:300 axonometric perspective, capturing the broader architectural context of my residential complex. Within this framework, I delineated a 50x50m boundary, utilizing rudimentary volumetric forms to articulate the communal spaces that define our residential enclave. My routine interactions within these communal spaces, particularly the pool and park areas, were accentuated, underscoring the dynamics of community engagement and leisurely pursuits, often accompanied by Hershey.

4) **Dynamic Narrative**: To encapsulate the multifaceted interactions and nuances of my living environment, I integrated a GIF component into the project. This dynamic narrative serves as a visual chronicle, elucidating my interactions within the space and offering viewers an immersive journey that highlights the intricate details of the three focal objects.

Through this project, I aimed to offer a personalized and insightful exploration of my living space, capturing the symbiotic relationship between personal elements, architectural nuances, and communal engagements within the urban tapestry.
