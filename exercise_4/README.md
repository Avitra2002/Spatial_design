## AI Powered Design Project
In this project we were challenged to reimagine an iconic design to evolving conditions and contexts. By altering classic design, we had to explore how shift in time, society, technology, environment and spatial dynamics can impact and transform design relevance.

#### Background on Converse:

With the significant advancements in rubber production technology in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries, Marquis Mills founded the Converse Rubber Shoe
Company in Massachusetts, US, specializing in manufacturing full-rubber footwear.
As Basketball started to gain popularity in the early 1900s, Mills decided to change
the company’s direction towards developing specialized athletic footwear and
introduced the “Non-Skids” in 1917, which was their first high-top, rubber-sole,
canvas shoes marketed as basketball-specific footwear.
In 1921, Converse hired a semi-professional basketball player named Charles
“Chuck” Taylor as a part-time salesman, who suggested improvements to the shoes’
design to enhance support and flexibility in a real game. This gave birth to the iconic
Converse Chuck Taylor All Star. Taylor went on to promote the footwear around the
US with the Converse Allstars basketball team, for which was the player manager, a
very successful campaign that saw Chuck Taylor’s name becoming part of the
Converse All Star brand.
Throughout the mid-20th century, the Chuck Taylor All Star was widely popular and
highly recognized. In 1936, it was featured as the official US Olympic team
basketball shoe, until 1968. It was even used as the official athletic shoe of the US
armed forces for their military training in 1939, during World War II. The shoe
enabled soldiers to train in a gym setting with more flexibility than the standard-issue
combat leather boots.

**Design Principles**
• Basketball-Centric Design:
The high-top design was engineered to provide essential ankle support for
basketball players, reducing the risk of injuries. The canvas upper and the rubber
toe cap and sole ensured durability in withstanding the rigorous demands of
basketball gameplay.
• Casual Aesthetic:

As fashion trends shifted towards casual and comfortable styles in the 1920s-
1930s, the Chuck Taylor All Star transitioned from a purely sports-centric shoe to

also serving as a casual staple. Its minimalist canvas upper, yet distinctive shape
and toe cap contributed to its timeless and versatile aesthetic.
• Signature, Functional Elements:
  o The iconic rubber toe cap, originally functional, transcended its utilitarian
purpose to become a visual hallmark of the shoes, embodying a rebellious
and distinctive aesthetic with its bolded look.
  o The ventilation holes on the side of the shoe’s upper, initially designed for
increased breathability, have evolved into a signature element. Users
creatively thread shoelaces through them, turning them into personalized
expressions of style. This showcases Converse's ability to seamlessly
combine functionality with a rebellious and creative design.

#### Our narrative
In our envisioned future, Earth has become uninhabitable, leading
humanity to establish a new home on Mars. This shift necessitates not
just a change in location but a profound transformation in how we
approach design and sustainability. Our project, the Martian Converse
shoe, is born out of this necessity. It symbolises a blend of practicality
and nostalgia – a piece of Earth's culture and history reimagined for
Martian life. The sustainable design ethos represent our commitment
to adaptability and environmental responsibility in this new world.
