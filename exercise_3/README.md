## Overview
In this exercise, I explored the use of smartphone LiDAR sensors to create 3D meshes of objects and individuals. Using applications like Luma AI and Polycam, I transformed these meshes into point clouds, enabling me to craft compelling narratives using software such as Rhino's Grasshopper and Blender.

### 3D Avatar Creation
Initially, I scanned myself and adjusted the mesh to create a personalized 3D figurine, which I subsequently 3D printed as a tangible souvenir of this innovative project.

#### Point Cloud manipulation
I then used blender with the volume tool to play with the point cloud to displace them and use tools like distribution points on surfaces, transform geometry, color map, map range and many more to achieve the story I want. 

Point Cloud Manipulation
I utilized Blender's advanced features to manipulate the point cloud, employing tools like the volume tool, distribution points on surfaces, transform geometry, color map, and map range to achieve the desired narrative.

Before embarking on this project, I watched the movie "Annihilation" on Netflix, which inspired me to create a design influenced by the film's enigmatic world.

The resulting image depicts a transformative journey, symbolized by the gradual metamorphosis of human elements into natural forms.In my creative exploration, the aura surrounding the figure symbolizes a gradual metamorphosis, where the skin appears to dissolve, revealing a mummified skeletal structure beneath. This transformation suggests a fusion of human and natural elements, as the skeletal tissue evolves into intricate tree branches adorned with blooming flowers, encapsulating a surreal and captivating narrative within the point cloud environment.

### Point Cloud Environment
Collaborating with a partner, we integrated our living spaces into the school's point cloud, focusing on the SUTD bus stop area.

_"**Riding to Relaxation**
After a long day at school, especially after four hours of spatial classes, what do we, as students, always think of? Yes, go home! So, we've located our rooms right at the bus stop, so that once the clock strikes 5 PM, we can immediately board our magical bus. This bus is not just any bus, but it's our 'home sweet home' bus. On level 1, we have arranged a gaming area at the driver's seat, and the rest is where we get a good night's sleep and freshen up for the next day. The second floor is for relaxation and staying in touch with nature, which we get to do a lot. Wow, what a work-life balance!_
