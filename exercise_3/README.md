## Point Cloud

In this exercise we learnt how to use our phones with lidar sensors to scan objects and ourselves to make 3D meshes of ourselves. The application that we used was Luma AI and polycam to make this project happen. We then converted them to point clouds that we can manipulate using sfotware like Rhino's grasshopper and blender to tell a story. 

#### 3D avater 3d printed
Firstly we scanned ourselves and adjsuted the mesh such that we can make a ligurine 3D model of ourselves and 3D printed it so that we can keep it as a souvenior.

#### Point Cloud manipulation
I then used blender with the volume tool to play with the point cloud to displace them and use tools like distribution points on surfaces, transform geometry, color map, map range and many more to achieve the story I want. 

Before I did this project, I watch the movie "annihilation" by Jeff VanderMeer on netflix where it is about the "shimmer", an area of land where the laws of nature dont apply. A group of biologist was sent into this area where it is filed with many plants and organism to examine them. Some of them look like humans and there were tarces of human DNA found in them. They also came into conclusiont that the "shimmer" modifies human DNA and made them into plants. I took inspiration from this and imagine what would i become if i was in the shimmer and made it using point clouds.

The aura around it like the skin leaving my body and the mummy like skeleton tissue is like the my muscles that is slowly turning into tree branches with flowers growing out of it.

### Point Cloud Environment
My partner and I were then tasked to integate our rooms and objects into the point cloud of the school and choose a specific area that we want. The area we choose was the SUTD bus stop. 

_"**Riding to Relaxation**
After a long day at school, especially after four hours of spatial classes, what do we, as students, always think of? Yes, go home! So, we've located our rooms right at the bus stop, so that once the clock strikes 5 PM, we can immediately board our magical bus. This bus is not just any bus, but it's our 'home sweet home' bus. On level 1, we have arranged a gaming area at the driver's seat, and the rest is where we get a good night's sleep and freshen up for the next day. The second floor is for relaxation and staying in touch with nature, which we get to do a lot. Wow, what a work-life balance!_
